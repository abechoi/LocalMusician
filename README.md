LOCALMUSICIAN APP
by Abe Choi

Using the Ticketmaster API, I was able to create an app where it 
utilized the data from Ticketmaster's database and populate the 
data in the app.


PROBLEMS WITH THE TICKETMASTER API
The venue and place variables were either inaccessible or I did
not know how to correctly implement it.


EXPERIMENTS
I originally tried to use the spotify app with the ticketmaster app 
so that I would be able to click on a venue and have the ability to
 listen to a preview of the artist.
